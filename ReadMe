About The Dataset:
The dataset utilised in this study was obtained from Kaggle [17], entitled ”Real
World Document Collections,” comprising 16 distinct classes with roughly 300
images in .jpg format per class. This dataset is a representative sample of the
RVL-CDIP dataset, which encompasses 4.45 GB of data. To train the CNN
model, Khaled Hushme removed class 14 (Scientific-publication)[shown in red],
which displayed comparable features and page layout to the ”news-article” class
, when utilising the benchmark algorithm. This resulted in an accuracy score
of 99.54 train, validation, and test sets [B.1.1] and used to train [A.1.1] the model. Additionally, CNN extracted features were applied on SVM [A.1.3], LR [A.1.4],
and RF [A.1.5] models with different parameters to study the neural network’s
behaviour and compare it with the benchmark algorithm.
Subset of Dataset 1:
However, due to computational limitations, HOG [A.1.2] features could not
be extracted using Dataset 1. To experiment with a smaller dataset on CNN and
traditional classifiers, the train set of Dataset 1 was divided into tn-hog, val-hog,
and tst-hog sets. This subset of Dataset 1 was used to extract HOG features
and apply them to SVM, LR, and RF models. Additionally, this subset was
used to train a CNN model and compare its accuracy with traditional classifiers
to evaluate the behaviour and the impact of dataset size on each model.
This subset of Dataset 1 was used to extract HOG features and apply on
SVM, LR and RF. Also used this data to train CNN model and compare its
accuracy with traditional classifiers to evaluate the behaviour and how data set
size matters in each of the models.
