 Real World Problem
The automatic classification and labeling of images of documents based on their
content is a real-world problem known as document image classification. There
is a rising need to appropriately categorize these images for a variety of applications, including document management, information retrieval, and data analysis, as a result of the expanding number of digitized documents that are already
available, such as scanned papers, electronic invoices, receipts, and forms. However, when dealing with massive volumes of data, manually classifying these
documents can be time-consuming and error-prone.
It is now possible to reach near-human performance in document image categorization thanks to recent developments in AI approaches and the accessibility
of powerful technology.
In several sectors, including banking, insurance, healthcare, and government,
where there is an enormous quantity of documents that need to be processed
and handled, AI is clearly needed for document image classification. AI may
assist in optimizing the workflow for document processing and classification,
which can save a lot of time and money while also improving productivity and
reducing errors. As a result, there is a significant need for AI-based document
image classification systems, and this is an important topic for AI research and
development. This section provides an introduction to the project.
